# CometChat React UI Kit

CometChat's React UI Kit provides a prepared user interface that developers can use to quickly incorporate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into their existing or new applications.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14.17.0
- npm >= 7

## Getting Started
To set up the CometChat React UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.

2. **Create an Application**: After registering, log in to your CometChat account and create a new application. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.

3. **Check the [Key Concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/react-uikit/key-concepts)** to understand the basic components of CometChat.
